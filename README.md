# EightBallPool

## Sumamry/Description
**EightBallPool** is a game written in Java. Two players take turns and shoot the white ball (cue ball) at other pool balls and try to pocket their own types (striped of solid) of pool balls. The player can click on the cue ball and drag the mouse to different locations to set the speed and the direction of the cue ball. When a player pockets the cue ball, the other player gets a free ball and can right click to place the cue ball wherever on the pool table. After pocketing all of the assigned type of pool balls, pocket the 8ball (black ball) to win.

## Rules
1: Each player has their own types of balls (stripes or solids). To determine each player's type of ball, the type of the first sunked ball will be assigned to the player that made it in while the opposite type is assigned to the other player.\
2: If a player shoots the ball but doesn't make any contact with another ball, the other player will be able to move the white ball on his/her turn. If a player doesn't make first contact with their assigned type of ball, the opposite player will get to move the white ball on his/her next turn as well.\
3: If a player sinks the white ball, the opposite player gets to place and move the white ball on his turn.\
4: If a player sinks in a ball of his/her type, he/she gets to go again.\
5: The first player to sink in the 8 ball AFTER sinking in all of the balls with his assigned type wins.\
6: If a player makes in the eightball without clearing all of his balls with his assinged type first, the opposite player wins the game.
